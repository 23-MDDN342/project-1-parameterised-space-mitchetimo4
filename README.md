### 2023 MDDN342 Project 1: Parameterised Space

Final Commit 23/03/23

My design is inspired by the many theories about the creation of the Great Pyramid of Giza. I wanted it to represent at least one of these theories while adhering to the breif. The result of this plan is a fully parameterized gif that can work on any scale and represents the thought that the construction might not have happened how we think it did. 

My original plan was to recreate the landscape of Giza with sidescrolling slabs that form pyramids when they line up. I achieved this although during the development I completely changed the way it was presented. Instead of creating a detailed landscape I went for a more simple design and changed the art direction to a more bright and vibrant, cartoonish feel. 

Although I strayed away from my orignial art style the idea I wanted to convey is still very much there. I beleive that I followed the brief well and that my final animation is sucessful in terms of what I wanted to create and what the brief wanted me to create.
