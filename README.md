### 2023 MDDN342 Project 1: Parameterised Space
EXAMPLE README 

My design is inspired by fireworks and flowers. I want it to be full of changes, so that every frame can have a fresh feeling.

In terms of concrete performance, I draw different geometric figures, let them spread out, and overlay their number at the same time, through the time difference to make the whole dynamic background become enthusiastic.

In terms of color, I made different shapes correspond to different colors, and changed the parameters so that they were different every time they appeared, so that there would be differences between different loops.

In the initial design, I only added the circle. Through the color change of the circle and the superposition of the movement track, although it has a good effect, I think it is too monotonous.

In the later stages, I added a lot of geometric shapes, which made the color and pattern more variable.

My first sketch is of two pyramids. the idea is to have two of the four layers slide to the right and the other two slide to the left, creating an endless loop of layers coming from each side of the screen. the movement should not be linear so the viewer has a chance to look at the pyramids breifly before they move again.

I now have all of the pyramid slabs moving and the right dimensions. Refer to development log for more info. My next step is to add more details but i have been thinking about rethinking the way i want to display what i have. I was originally going to create a scene/setting where the pyramids were in an accurate environment. i have started to rethink this because it feels too busy with the amount of movement. im leaning towards more of an abstract approach but i might backtrack if it doesnt work out. The next step is to experiment with some new designs and then ofc add some more detail.

The detail on the slabs has now been added. It is easy to tell that they are pyramids now rather than just triangles being formed over and over. It does however make the animtaion rather busy. If after the next step when i have added the clouds in the lines are making it too busy i am still open to removing them and going with the slabs rather than bricks.
